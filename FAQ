BuGLe: questions that nobody has asked yet, but which they might...
===================================================================

Q. My program crashes, somewhere deep inside the OpenGL driver and I
can't get a stack trace. How can I tell what caused it?
A. Use the "unwindstack" filterset, and see doc/example.txt for
documentation.
A. Use the "log" filterset, and turn on the flush option (see the example
in doc/example.txt). Then after your program crashes, the last entry
in the log file will most likely be the one just before the crash.

Q. I don't want to have to set BUGLE_CHAIN all the time; can't I
specify a default?
A. The first chain in the configuration file is the default.

Q. I don't want to have to set LD_PRELOAD all the time, or it is not
available on my system. Can I just link directly to BuGLe?
A. Yes, you can specify -lbugle in place of -lGL when you link. If it
is not installed in a standard directory, you may need extra compiler
flags, such as -L/path/to/bugle -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/path/to/bugle

Q. What is the performance penality?
A. That depends on what you're doing with the library, but to give you
an example, here are some rough numbers for Quake3 1.32 on demo 'four'
(not even remotely scientificly collected).

without BuGLe: 133fps
with just the "invoke" filterset: 125fps
with the wireframe filterset: 125fps
with logging to /dev/null: 48fps
with logging to file: 47fps

So basically, the framework adds a little, and logging adds a lot.

Q. How do you get Quake3 to use BuGLE?
A. Run it as quake3 +set r_glDriver /path/to/libbugle.so

Q. Why am I getting errors about unknown GL tokens?
A. BuGLe assumes that your GL header files are reasonably up to date.
You should try getting an updated glext.h from Sun:
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/

Q. I have a 64-bit machine, and I get errors trying to compile or run
the library. Why?
A. It is probably because the code generator relies on the file
src/data/gl.tu. This file contains a parse tree of gl.h, glext.h and
glx.h. It is machine-dependent, but is packaged anyway because it
requires gcc 3.x to regenerate and because the code generated from it
should still be machine-independent. Try removing this file and
recompiling (in which case you need gcc 3.x; 3.3.2 is tested), and if
it works let me know so that I can fix it.

Q. I'm running Bob's Incredibly Obscure UNIX system, and the library
doesn't compile/work.
A. If the platform is POSIX compliant and supports dynamic loading
via dlopen() and preloading via LD_PRELOAD, then it should be supported
more or less supported right now and this is a bug. Please let me know
about it.

Q. Why is there a mix of C and C++ code?
A. The library itself is written entirely in C. This is mainly because
a C++ library will drag libstdc++ in with it, and this has been found to
create some problems when forcing linking to an app that already
depends on a conflicting version of libstdc++. There is still a
dependence on libc, but libc is less of a moving target. The code
generator is written in C++, since it makes the coding easier and does
not introduce the dependency issues above.
