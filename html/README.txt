BuGLe combines a graphical OpenGL debugger with a selection of filters
on the OpenGL command stream. The debugger allows viewing of state,
textures, framebuffers and shaders, while the filters allow for
logging, error checking, video capture and more. It operates on
GLX-based systems.

BuGLe is maintained by Bruce Merry [bmerry@users.sourceforge.net].
