        &Bugle; is an toolkit for debugging and profiling OpenGL applications
        running on UNIX-like systems. It consists of two parts: a collection
        of <firstterm>filter-sets</firstterm> that observe and sometimes
        modify calls to the OpenGL API, and a graphical <link
            linkend="gldb-gui.1">debugger</link> that helps in examining
        state, setting breakpoints, and capturing errors.
    </para>
    <para>
        &Bugle; is still in active development, and is considered
        <quote>alpha</quote>. What this means is that while there are a lot of
        features, any given one of them might be broken on any given day. If
        you do find a bug, please let me know
        (<email>bmerry@users.sourceforge.net</email>).
    </para>
    <para>
        To get started with &bugle;, first read the <link
            linkend="install">installation instructions</link>, and refer to
        the <link linkend="faq">FAQ</link> if you run into any problems. If
        you just want to use the debugger, you can skip straight to its <link
            linkend="gldb-gui.1">manual page</link>. Otherwise, start with the
        overview <link linkend="bugle.3">manual page</link> for &bugle; to
        learn how to use it, then find the filter-sets you want in the <link
            linkend="manpages">reference manual</link>.
