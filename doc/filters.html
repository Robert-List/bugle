        <h1>Writing plugins for BuGLe</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        Eventually, this file will serve as a guide for third party plugin
        authors. At present, the API is still too unstable for this to be
        practical, and the ABI will vary between machines with different OpenGL
        headers. To repeat: you <strong>cannot</strong> just distribute binary
        filter-sets and expect them to work. If you decide to write a plugin
        anyway, consider submitting it to the program author for inclusion, so
        that he can maintain it across API changes.
        </p>

        <p>
        Filters are arranged in a four-level hierarchy:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Filter libraries, which are a loose collection of filter-sets. These
            allow filters to be grouped together to avoid having hundreds of
            files. It also makes shared access to data easier.</li>
            <li>Filter-sets, which are tightly coupled groups of filters. Each
            filter-set may have state, may depend upon other filter-sets and may
            only be loaded or unloaded as a unit.</li>
            <li>Filters, which are used to control sequencing. For example, some
            filter-sets need to have some code run before calls are executed and
            other code after. These pieces of code would be placed in separate
            filters. The plugin author may list ordering dependencies between
            filters.</li>
            <li>Callbacks, which are the actual functions that act on calls. A
            filter may register multiple callbacks, each of which acts on some
            subset of the possible calls.
        </ol>

        <h2>Loading vs. activation</h2>
        <p>
        In order to allow modifiers to be turned on or off on the fly, there
        is a distinction between loading and activation. All filter-sets
        listed in the chain are loaded, but should alter the behaviour of
        the program only when <em>active</em>. Filter-sets are loaded only
        at startup and unloaded at program termination, but can be
        activated or deactivated arbitrarily. Most callbacks are only called
        when the filter-set is active, but it is possible to register
        callbacks that are called even when the filter-set is inactive.
        This allows the filter-set to monitor state so that it can do the
        right thing during activation, or to execute cleanup code after
        deactivation.
        </p>

        <h2>Filter-related structures and typedefs</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>filter_set</code></dt>
            <dd>An opaque structure representing a filter-set.</dd>
            <dt><code>filter</code></dt>
            <dd>An opaque structure representing a filter.</dd>
            <dt><code>filter_set_variable_info</code></dt>
            <dd>A user-supplied structure that describes one filter-set variable
            that can be set from the configuration file. It has the following fields:
            <dl>
                <dt><code>name</code></dt>
                <dd>The name to match in the configuration file.</dd>
                <dt><code>help</code></dt>
                <dd>The help string to show when help is requested. This may be
                <code>NULL</code> to leave the variable undocumented.</dd>
                <dt><code>type</code></dt>
                <dd>The type of variable. It must be one of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>FILTER_SET_VARIABLE_STRING</code> (a general string)</li>
                    <li><code>FILTER_SET_VARIABLE_INT</code> (a general integer)</li>
                    <li><code>FILTER_SET_VARIABLE_UINT</code> (a non-negative integer)</li>
                    <li><code>FILTER_SET_VARIABLE_POSITIVE_INT</code> (a positive integer)</li>
                    <li><code>FILTER_SET_VARIABLE_BOOL</code> (a boolean value)</li>
                    <li><code>FILTER_SET_VARIABLE_KEY</code> (a
                    xevent_key structure, which holds an X KeySym and a shift mask)</li> 
                    <li><code>FILTER_SET_VARIABLE_CUSTOM</code> (any
                    type, with a callback to assign the value)</li>
                </ul>
                </dd>
                <dt><code>value</code></dt>
                <dd>A <code>void</code> pointer to a location to update. For the integer
                types, the target must be of type <code>long</code> and for string
                variables it must be of type <code>char *</code>. In
                the latter case, the value written in
                is a copy of the string, and you are responsible for freeing it. If the
                old value was non-<code>NULL</code>, it will be freed first (so be
                sure to use a static initialisation to <code>NULL</code>; if you want
                a non-<code>NULL</code> default then you must allocate the memory). It
                is also legal for <code>value</code> to be <code>NULL</code>, in which case
                no assignment is done.</dd>
                <dt><code>callback</code></dt>
                <dd>A callback function that runs before the assignment. It has the
                signature
<pre>
bool callback(const filter_set_variable_info *info, const char *text, void *value);
</pre>
                The <code>text</code> is the literal string value from the configuration file,
                while <code>value</code> is interpreted in the same way as the <code>value</code>
                field in the structure (note: the parameter will be meaningful even if the
                structure provides a <code>value</code> of <code>NULL</code>). The
                <code>value</code> may be overridden by the callback. The return value should
                be <code>true</code> unless the value is determined to be illegal, in which
                case it should print a message to <code>stderr</code> and return
                <code>false</code>. The callback may also be <code>NULL</code> (and usually will be).
                </dd>
            </dl>
            </dd>
            <dt><code>filter_set_variable_type</code></dt>
            <dd>An <code>enum</code> of the possible values for the <code>type</code>
            field above.</dd>
            <dt><code>filter_set_info</code></dt>
            <dd>A structure used to register a filter-set. It has the following fields:
            <dl>
                <dt><code>name</code></dt>
                <dd>The name of the filter-set, to be used in the configuration file.</dd>
                <dt><code>load</code></dt>
                <dd>A callback function used to initialise the filter-set. It has the
                following signature:
<pre>
bool filter_set_loader(filter_set *);
</pre>
                It should return <code>true</code> on success and <code>false</code> on
                failure. See below for more information on initialisation. 
                </dd>
                <dt><code>unload</code></dt>
                <dd>A shutdown function for the filter-set, with signature
<pre>
void filter_set_unload(filter_set *);
</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><code>activate</code></dt>
                <dd>An optional activation function, with signature
<pre>
void filter_set_activator(filter_set *);
</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><code>deactivate</code></dt>
                <dd>An optional deactivator function, with signature
<pre>
void filter_set_deactivator(filter_set *);
</pre>
                </dd>
                <dt><code>variables</code></dt>
                <dd>A pointer to an array of <code>filter_set_variable_info</code> structures,
                terminated by a null structure <code>{NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL}</code>. This
                describes the user variables that are accepted by the filter-set. If there
                are no variables, this field may be <code>NULL</code>.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>call_state_space</code></dt>
                <dd>An integer number of bytes of storage to piggy-back on to the
                call structure. This will probably go away soon and it is recommended
                that it is set to <code>0</code> for now.
                </dd>
                <dt><code>help</code></dt>
                <dd>The help string to show when help is requested. This may be left
                as <code>NULL</code> to leave the filter-set undocumented. This is
                recommended for internal or helper filter-sets.</dd>
            </dl>
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Other structures and typedefs</h2>
        <p>
        Bugle makes a sharp distinction between functions and groups. A
        function is what you think it is. A group is a set of functions with
        identical parameters and semantics. In OpenGL, groups arise from the
        fact that functions are promoted between extensions or from extensions
        to the core; for example <code>glActiveTexture</code> and
        <code>glActiveTextureARB</code> are equivalent functions and belong to
        the same group.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each GL function is assigned a number in the range [0,
        <code>NUMBER_OF_FUNCTIONS</code>). These numbers are conventionally of
        type <code>budgie_function</code>, which is some signed integral type.
        There is also a special value <code>NULL_FUNCTION</code>, which is
        simply <code>-1</code>. For each function <code>glSomeFunction</code>,
        there is a typedef <code>FUNC_glSomeFunction</code> which is the number
        assigned to the function.
        </p>
        <p>
        Similar, groups are numbered from 0 to <code>NUMBER_OF_GROUPS</code>
        and given defines <code>GROUP_glSomeFunction</code>. Groups do not have
        explicit names, but are referenced by any of the functions in the
        group.
        </p>
        <p>
        BuGLe tries to support systems that only have header files and runtime
        support for OpenGL 1.1 (so that a Win32 port will be possible one day).
        Thus for any functions introduces after 1.1, you should favour the
        <code>GROUP_</code> definition with the oldest name, which is generally
        an extension function. You should also protect any such code with a
        test for the GL extension define e.g.
        <code>GL_ARB_multitexture</code>.

        <h2>Library initialisation</h2>
        <p>
        Each filter library must define an initialisation function called
        <code>bugle_initialise_filter_library</code> which takes no parameters
        and no return. This function registers all the filter-sets in the
        library, as well as their dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
        Filter-sets are registered by passing a pointer to a
        <code>filter_set_info</code> structure (see above) to
        <code>bugle_register_filter_set</code>. Some of the fields in the
        structure are used later in-place rather than copied, so the structure
        (including the variables array) must have global lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
        Dependencies are registered by calling
        </p>
<pre>
bugle_register_filter_set_depends("<em>set1</em>", "<em>set2</em>")
</pre>
        <p>
        to indicate that <em>set1</em> requires <em>set2</em> to be
        present for operation.
        </p>

        <h2>Filter-set loading</h2>
        <p>
        Apart from initialising internal structures, a filter-set loader
        registers filters and callbacks. A filter is created by calling
        <code>bugle_register_filter(handle, "<em>filtername</em>")</code>
        This function returns a <code>filter *</code> which should be saved for
        later use.
        </p>
        <p>There are two ways to register a callback:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>bugle_register_filter_catches(filter *<em>filter</em>,
                budgie_function <em>function</em>,
                bool <em>inactive</em>,
                filter_callback <em>callback</em>)</code></dt>
            <dd>Registers a callback function that will apply to a single GL function
            (or several if called several times). The <em>function</em> should be
            one of the <code>CFUNC_*</code> defines; other names for the same
            function are also trapped. If <em>inactive</em> is <code>true</code>, the
            callback will be called even if the filter-set is inactive (see below
            for an explanation of active and inactive filter-sets).</dd>

            <dt><code>bugle_register_filter_catches_all(filter *<em>filter</em>,
                bool <em>inactive</em>,
                filter_callback <em>callback</em>)</code></dt>
            <dd>Registers a callback function that will apply to all GL functions.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
        In addition, you should list sequencing requirements between filters. To
        specify that <em>filter1</em> must run after <em>filter2</em> if both
        are present, call <code>bugle_register_filter_depends("<em>filter1</em>",
            "<em>filter2</em>")</code>. An important filter for setting dependencies is
        the built-in <code>invoke</code> filter, which actually executes GL
        functions.
        </p>

        <h2>Writing callbacks</h2>
        <p>
        A callback has the following signature:
        </p>
<pre>
bool callback(function_call *<em>call</em>, const callback_data *<em>data</em>)
</pre>
        <p>
        The callback should generally return <code>true</code>. Returning <code>false</code>
        aborts any further processing of the call (including execution if the
        <code>invoke</code> filter has not yet run). This can be useful if you
        want to suppress a call, but if possible it is better to allow
        execution and undo the effects afterwards so that later filters get a
        chance to run.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <em>data</em> element will likely change or go away in the near
        future, so it will not be documented here.
        </p>
        <p>
        Callbacks that handle multiple GL functions will need to know which GL
        function was called; the function is found in
        <code>call->generic.id</code>, but more useful is the group found in
        <code>call->generic.group</code>. One can also get access to the
        arguments: if the call is known to be <code>glSomeFunction</code>, then
        <code>*call->typed.glSomeFunction.arg<em>i</em></code> is the
        <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> argument, and
        <code>*call->typed.glSomeFunction.retn</code> is the return value. If
        the function is not known at compile time, then the
        arguments can be accessed via the <code>void</code> pointers
        <code>call->generic.args[<em>i</em>]</code> and
        <code>call->generic.retn</code>.
        These values can also be modified to change the arguments used or the
        value returned to the application, respectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Making GL calls</h3>
        <p>
        There are some issues to be aware of if you want your callbacks to
        themselves make calls to GL/GLX. Firstly, if you make the call in the
        obvious way, it will be intercepted in the same way as all other GL/GLX
        calls. There is protection against this, so everything will continue to
        work, but there will be a loss of performance. Instead, you should
        prefix the name of the function with <code>CALL_</code>. e.g.
        </p>
<pre>
CALL_glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
</pre>
        <p>
        If there is no current
        context, then you should not make any calls to OpenGL (GLX is okay
        though). In addition, almost all OpenGL calls, and context-switching
        GLX calls, are illegal between <code>glBegin</code> and
        <code>glEnd</code>. It is also illegal to switch contexts while in
        feedback or selection mode, although this is not well handled at the
        moment. Finally, remember that BuGLe aims to support OpenGL 1.1 and
        thus anything not in OpenGL 1.1 must be treated as an extension.
        </p>
        <p>
        To simplify matters, some utility functions are provided.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For filter-set <em>foo</em> that makes calls to GL/GLX, one must
            call <code>bugle_register_filter_set_renders("<em>foo</em>")</code> in
            the library initialiser. This causes the filter-set to depend on the
            necessary utility filter-sets. In addition, for each filter
            <em>bar</em> that makes GL/GLX calls after the captured call is
            executed, one must call
            <code>bugle_register_filter_post_renders("<em>bar</em>")</code>. This inserts
            ordering dependencies to ensure that errors from the original call are
            not confused with errors generated by the inserted calls.</li>
            <li>Before attempting to make OpenGL calls, call
            <code>bugle_begin_internal_render()</code>. If it returns false, then
            it is not safe to render at this time. Otherwise, make your calls, then
            call <code>bugle_end_internal_render("<em>name</em>",
                <em>warn</em>)</code>. If <em>warn</em> is true and your calls
            generated any GL errors, then a warning will be written to standard
            error including <em>name</em> (which should be the name of the callback
            function).</li>
            <li>If you are intercepting a call that belongs to an extension, then
            it is safe to assume that the extension is present (if it isn't, then
            the app is at fault). Otherwise, you need to check for any extensions
            you use. Your filter-set must depend on <em>trackextensions</em>, and
            you must call
            <code>bugle_gl_has_extension(BUGLE_GL_EXT_some_extension)</code>
            to determine whether the extension is present (the defines for
            available extensions are in the generated file <code>glexts.h</code>).
            This is a relatively cheap operation, since the list of available
            extensions is parsed at context creation time rather than call
            time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sharing symbols between libraries</h3>
        <p>
        Sometimes it is necessary to access variables or functions that reside
        in a different filter library. To get a <code>filter_set *</code>
        handle to the filter-set <em>foo</em>, call</p>
<pre>
bugle_get_filter_set_handle("<em>foo</em>")
</pre>
        <p>
        With a <code>filter_set *</code> handle, symbols (global variables and
        functions) are obtained with</p>
<pre>
bugle_get_filter_set_symbol(<em>handle</em>, "<em>symbol</em>")
</pre>

        <h3>State management</h3>
        <p>
        BuGLe is designed from the ground up to work with multiple contexts,
        and a good filter should as well. Part of this is recognising that a
        lot of things that you might want to store in global variables in fact
        needs a copy per context. BuGLe has a fairly generic method for
        associating state with various objects such as contexts, which is
        described in <a href="objects.html">objects.html</a>.</p>

        <h3>Logging</h3>
        <p>
        BuGLe has a logging system that acts as a built-in filter-set. If you
        intend to do any logging, see the comments at the top of
        <code>src/log.h</code>.</p>

        <h3>Conventions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If a filter named <em>filter</em> has only one callback, call it
            <code><em>filter</em>_callback</code>. If
            it has one for each of several functions, then call each
            <code><em>filter</em>_glSomeFunction</code>.</li>
        </ol>
