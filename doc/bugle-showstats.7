.TH showstats 7 "May 2006" BUGLE "User manual"
.SH NAME
showstats \- render statistics over the display
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
filterset frontbuffer
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B stats
filter-set gathers statistics about the rendering, such as frame rate.
When this filter-set is also used, the statistics are displayed in the
rendered window.
.SH BUGS
The filter-set has some overhead. You should use the
.B log
filterset to record statistics to file if you want to get accurate
frame-rate measurements.

Resizing the window can cause the stats display to be misplaced.

If the background is white it is impossible to see the statistics.
