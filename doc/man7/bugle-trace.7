.TH trace 7 "May 2006" BUGLE "User manual"
.SH NAME
trace \- record a log of all OpenGL calls made
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
filterset trace
filterset log
filterset error
.SH DESCRIPTION
This filter-set provides a log of the OpenGL calls made. For each call,
the function name, the parameters and the return value (if any) are
recorded. Where appropriate, symbolic names are shown for
.B GLenum
parameters, and pointers are followed to show the correct number of
elements. If the
.B error
filter-set is also loaded, any OpenGL errors generated by the call are
reported immediately afterwards.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no options to control this filter-set. All logging is done
through the
.B log
filter-set, and options such as filename and log format can be modified
there.
.SH OUTPUT
Here is a sample log output
.IP
.nf
trace.call: glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
trace.call: glLoadMatrixd(0xbfffe610 -> { { 0, -0.29661, 1.22295, 0 }, { 1.22295, 0, 0, 0 }, { 0, 1.18644, 0.305739, 0 }, { 0.037888, 1.61781, -1.52576, 1 } })
trace.call: glActiveTextureARB(GL_TEXTURE0)
trace.call: glTexEnvfv(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_COLOR, 0xbfffe5d0 -> { 0.778524, 0.778524, 0.569631, 0 })

.SH BUGS
Some enumerants share values, so you may see a different symbolic name
in the log than in your source code. It is believed that this should
now be limited to cases where extensions share a value for semanticly
equivalent symbols; if you find a case where this is not true, please
inform the author.

Because the filter-set examines arguments and follows pointers, it is
possible to crash it by passing invalid values, particularly invalid
pointers.
