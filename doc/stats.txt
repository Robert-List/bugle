There are two important types: signals and statistics. 

A signal is a value that changes over time - in theory it could change
continuously, but of course it can only be updated discretely.
Events-related signals (such as "triangles") are stored as a total over
time.

A statistic is a value that is computed from signals, and is measured
over some *interval* of time. A statistic also has associated metadata
that describes how it should be displayed and graphed.
