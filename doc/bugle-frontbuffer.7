.TH frontbuffer 7 "May 2006" BUGLE "User manual"
.SH NAME
frontbuffer \- force rendering to the front buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
filterset frontbuffer
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B frontbuffer
filter-set overrides the draw buffer, setting it to
.BR GL_FRONT .
This is most useful when used within
.BR gldb (1),
in order to see how a scene is built up batch by batch.
.SH BUGS
As with any filter-set that modifies OpenGL state, it will break
complex rendering techniques like render-to-vertex-buffer.

Rendering to off-screen buffers (such as pbuffers) and multiple render
targets are not tested and may fail.
