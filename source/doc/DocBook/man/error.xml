        <para>
            This filter-set does not take any visible action on its own, but
            provides a service to other filter-sets. It calls &mp-glGetError;
            after every OpenGL call to detect OpenGL errors (it does not
            detect X errors).
        </para>
        <para>
            Usually you will not need to explicitly load this filter-set; if
            you want to be informed of OpenGL errors, either use the
            <systemitem>showerror</systemitem> filterset, or
            &mp-gldb-gui;. However, you may
            occasionally see the message
            <screen><computeroutput>An OpenGL error was detected but will be lost to the application.</computeroutput></screen>
            This means that <application>bugle</application>'s internal
            error-checking code accidentally collected an error caused by one
            of your calls, and thus if your application later called
            &mp-glGetError;
            it would not be informed of the error. However, if you add the
            <systemitem>error</systemitem> filter-set, it will catch the error
            first and your application will be correctly informed of the
            error.

        <para>
            Because the error reporting semantics of OpenGL are not completely
            defined (in particular, an implementation may choose how many
            error flags it has), it is impossible to guarantee that this
            filter-set is completely transparent to the application. However,
            the first call to &mp-glGetError;
            always return an error, and in practice this is all that is
            necessary.
