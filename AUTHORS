BuGLe is written by Bruce Merry (bmerry@users.sourceforge.net).

Portions of code, and the whole of c-common.def and tree.def,
are taken from gcc. c-common.def and tree.def are copied verbatim from
gcc 3.4.0, which can be obtained from http://gcc.gnu.org.

The files GLee.c and GLee.h in the tests/ directory are copied verbatim
GLee 5.02, which can be obtained from http://elfstone.com. It has its
own licence, which is included at the top of the files. Note that no
GLee code is installed by 'make install'; it is used only for the test
suite.
