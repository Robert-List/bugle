* Added checks filterset
* Improved support for systems short on extensions
* Changed the way tests are done (using regexes) to make them more

0.0.20041108
------------
* Fix crash in video capture (not sure how it ever worked)

0.0.20041025
------------
* Redo libreadline detection to fall back gracefully if the library
  doesn't link properly, and to explicitly link against libncurses if
  present (needed for Slackware with readline 5, apparently)
* Better support for older versions of glext.h, as well as better support
  for possible future versions where extensions get promoted to core.
* Better dumping of GLSLang functions (GetUniformARB needs works still).
* Fix interception of glXGetProcAddressARB (was not loading the filter)

0.0.20041011

* (capture) By default, skip or duplicate frames for videos
* Fold old types.c and types.h into utils.c and utils.h
* Introduce names.c and names.h, to hold just the names of the functions
* Rewrite the token capture system, which now captures extension info
* New system to capture which functions belong to which extensions
* Support for per-context, per-filter state
* Move tracker library into the core source
* Move logging into the core source, and split the tracing functionality
  out into a 'trace' module
* Make gldb and libbugleutils independent of GL and X
* Hex output of GLXDrawable (looks nicer, plus removes spurious regression
  errors)

0.0.20040903

  and use GL_EXT_pixel_buffer_object for possibly faster capture.

0.0.20040719
------------
* Added ability to stop running program with Ctrl-C.
* Improved thread safety.
* Rewrite of the state code
* Added basic state dump support to gldb
