This is a 'null' platform. The functions don't do anything, but it has all
the interfaces so that one can link against it. The purpose is to test that
the portable code doesn't depend on any of the functions that end up being
exposed when using the 'posix' platform due to _POSIX_C_SOURCE being defined.
