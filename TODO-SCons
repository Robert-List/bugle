- document that only a few key names are known on Win32
- should not put LD_PRELOAD= in help on Win32
- stats_fragment seems to be broken on Win32?
- retest on Win32
- update version strings, and work through RELEASE doc

Future:
- audit use of malloc/bugle_malloc/free/bugle_free for matching up
- fix warnings about not finding wglMakeContextCurrent or whatever it was
- avoid creating static libs for filters in Mingw
- unit tests:
  - I/O layer
  - socket API
- gldb-common is still rather platform-specific
- portable printf implementation, from newlib/gnulib/glibc/elsewhere?
- add platform layer for glib/gnulib?
