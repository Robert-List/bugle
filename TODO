WGL port
--------
- figure out why showstats on shadowfun crashes on exit (glDeleteQueries not defined?)
- better robustness to missing WGL/GLX extensions
- proper abstraction layer over xevent
- support read != draw DC in glwin.c
- handle cross-DLL data import/export cleanly
- put suitable visibility tags on all export functions, so that -export-symbols-regex and --export-all-symbols are not needed
- load opengl32.dll from SYSTEMDIR rather than hard-coded path.
- make gldb and gldb-gui work
  - kill takes out gldb-gui
- prevent libraries from being loaded twice
- fix crash in shutdown on es2demo
- make Cygwin work

GLES port
---------
- extend extension chains mechanism to extension sets
- make CALL multiplex between different functions in a group
- remove a lot of extension #define checks
- update gengl.pl to indicate which desktop extensions existing in GLES2
- put in FBO wrapper layer, similar to GLSL
- autogenerate egl-win.def
- track texture data so that it can be queried
- make gldb-gui work

camera filter-set
-----------------
- handle display lists properly
- do the right thing when event handling is in a different
  thread to rendering
- invalidate every frame when a motion key is depressed

gldb
----
- allow Ctrl-C to abort current line when reading commands
- set filter variables on the fly
- enable reporting of segfaults
- break on particular GL errors, not just 'all errors'
- fix display of uniform arrays

gldb-gui
--------
- VBO decode
- convert state names to UTF8
- enabling and disabling filter sets, and setting variables
- texture viewer:
  - interaction with cube map cube
  - display of pixel values on cube map
  - stats
  - LOD bias
  - alpha blending / display of alpha
  - test sRGB textures
  - better export for non [0,1] colours e.g. OpenEXR export
- shader viewer
  - show metadata like uniforms, info log
- test for all extensions before using them
- trace window?
- figure out why BadValue is sometimes generated on exit
- statistics tab
- state diffs
  - diff to the default
  - checkpointing

bugle
-----
- dump backtrace on error
- check whether all dependencies on trackextensions are listed
- fix leak of aux contexts on glXDestroyContext
- exploit per-context, per-filter state e.g. for video
- option to use pid in log filename or log file
- proper support for enabled but inactive filtersets
- handle use of GLX_SGIX_fbconfig rather than GLX 1.3 to manage contexts
- make segfault handling adhere better to POSIX
- rewrite some things to use hash tables
- autoconf test for GLENUM_IS_GLUINT
- cap overrides
- memory use statistics
- better handling of texture proxies
- fill in the rest of the state (image state, mainly)
- handle GL shared and unshared objects correctly (queries unshared)
- mirror GL objects (textures etc) in the bugle object system
- improve support for GLSL (more type information)
- capture more information about call lists
- capture and replay
- improve bugle_call_get_error and bugle_begin_internal_render so that using
  them doesn't require every single function call to be intercepted
- support for GL_GREMEDY_string_marker and GL_GREMEDY_frame_terminator
- finish documenting API in DocBook

budgie
------
- more autoconf tests (e.g. regex)
- robust logging, to avoid segfaulting
- move filter framework into budgie? May suck in xevent stuff

tests
-----
- multithreaded conformance tests
- coverage tests (glean?)
- autotool tests for glut

long term
---------
- internationalisation
- OpenEXR export
- Windows support
- OpenGL 3.0 support
- make gldb-gui tabs totally modular (separate shared objects)
- write support for state
- robust network debugging protocol
- shader debugging
- better movie capture
  - option of a separate thread, for parallel encoding
