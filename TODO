gldb
----
- allow Ctrl-C to abort current line when reading commands
- make pushing enter in gldb rerun last command
- enable and disable filters on the fly
- set filter variables on the fly
- enable reporting of segfaults
- print full dump of current function
- break on particular GL errors, not just 'all errors'

bugle
-----
- thread safety
- make segfault handling adhere better to POSIX
- rewrite some things to use hash tables
- autoconf test for GLENUM_IS_GLUINT
- use ltdl for loading modules
- cap and extension overrides
- wrap glXGetProcAddress
- statistics
- capture information about call lists
- profiling
- use dump overrides rather than alterative types for alt enums and errors?
- capture and replay

budgie
------
- redesign state specification grammar
- more autoconf tests (e.g. regex)
- robust logging, to avoid segfaulting
- dump expressions rather than dump functions
- move filter code into budgie?
- write support for state
- capture and replay
- better separation between libbugleutils and libbugle, so that only the
  latter requires GL and X libraries

tests
-----
- multithreaded tests
- coverage tests
- test for glut

general
-------
- more documentation
- allow the filter chain to be selectively bypassed, for benchmarking purposes

long term
---------
- internationalisation
- Windows support
