gldb
----
- allow Ctrl-C to abort current line when reading commands
- make pushing enter in gldb rerun last command
- enable and disable filters on the fly
- set filter variables on the fly
- enable reporting of segfaults
- print full dump of current function
- break on particular GL errors, not just 'all errors'
- better handling of state dumps (assemble on client side)
- tab completion for state

bugle
-----
- make segfault handling adhere better to POSIX
- rewrite some things to use hash tables
- autoconf test for GLENUM_IS_GLUINT
- use ltdl for loading modules
- cap and extension overrides
- fill in the rest of the state
- handle texture proxies
- handle GL shared objects correctly
- statistics and profiling
- capture information about call lists
- capture and replay
- better movie capture
  - use MMX for faster mirroring
  - use PBO for async readback
  - option of a separate thread, for parallel encoding
  - frame rate control
  - --without-lavc configure option
- better separation between libbugleutils and libbugle, so that only the
  latter requires GL and X libraries

budgie
------
- more autoconf tests (e.g. regex)
- robust logging, to avoid segfaulting
- move filter code into budgie?
- write support for state

tests
-----
- multithreaded conformance tests
- coverage tests
- tests for glut

general
-------
- more documentation
- allow the filter chain to be selectively bypassed, for benchmarking purposes

long term
---------
- internationalisation
- Windows support
