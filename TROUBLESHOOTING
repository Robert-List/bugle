P: I am getting the error 'Invalid option -fdump-translation-unit' or
similar.
S: You need to use a version of gcc that supports this flag. Version
3.2 and newer are known to, but 3.0 and 2.95 do not. I'm not sure about
3.1.

P: I am getting the error "could not find GL/glext.h"
S: You need to have this file, as it defines extensions to OpenGL that
an application might use. Obtain the latest copy from
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry. If you don't want to
put it in your system include directories, you can create a GL
subdirectory of your source directory and put it there.

For any other problems, contact me at bmerry@users.sourceforge.net. If
you are having compilation problems, then it would help to include the
generated file src/data/gl.tu, assuming compilation got that far. Be
aware that this file is generated from your OpenGL header files, and if
you are using proprietry OpenGL headers then there is a small chance
that distributing this file violates the vendor's copyright.
