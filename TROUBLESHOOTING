P: I am getting the error 'Invalid option -fdump-translation-unit' or
similar.
S: You need to use a version of gcc that supports this flag. Version
3.2 and newer are known to, but 3.0 and 2.95 do not.

P: I am getting the error "could not find GL/glext.h"
S: You need to have this file, as it defines extensions to OpenGL that
an application might use. Obtain the latest copy from
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry. If you don't want to
put it in your system include directories, you can create a GL
subdirectory of your source directory and put it there.
